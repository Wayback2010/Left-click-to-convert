# Left-click-to-convert
Allows you to convert certain file types to other file types (png to webp for example) from the context menu (right click menu) in file explorer
# How to use
Download the zip, unzip it, and run `setup.exe`. Make sure that `converter.exe` is in the same directory. Unless it shows an error, `converter.exe` should dissapear and the terminal should print "Successfully added context menu entry." Then, in file explorer, you can right click, select "more options", and then select "Convert to another file type".
